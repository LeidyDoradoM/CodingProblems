# Practicing Data Structures & Algorithms

This repository has been created for organizing and storing my solutions to different problems about data structures and algorithms. Here, you can find a great variety of problems, from basic to some of the most commonly questions asked in technical interviews.

The solutions are implemented in Python and the subject of questions ranged from array and python lists to data structures such as stacks, queues and dictionaries.

Some exercises are part of the "Algorithms and Data Structure" course in Udemy platform, while another ones are taken from websites as LeetCode, Codewars.
